BUG : objects not rendered when insisting alternating goto moon goto ext !!!!

clean imports from *

follow with lockcamera (parenting to followed)
follow and lookat without slowdowns (predictive movement)
and this camera mover class should be aware of running intervals
Camera INputHd and Interface should have scene as paramteter (not world)

look and follow instructions should be added to a list and then done sequentially
OR BETTER
done in parallel conserving speed

markers should not be seen when on camera position (0,0,0)

tubular shadow should be set on a sun at infinite (to be aligned with shadow caster)

support years before 1 and 9999
support dates defore christ (datautil.date)

show correct moon face when realist


go forward 1 day, 1 month, 1season, 1year (soft date change)

INTERFACE !!
when go somewhere look at previous location
check "maychange" option on text
