show shadows on models congruent with tubular shadows
--> tubular shadow should be set on a sun at infinite (to be aligned with shadow caster)
(new shadow object and change their appearances according to position)
or multiple shadow casters and model lighters

non realist scale should permit full sun eclipse (not annular)

put the docs in the software !! 
make small website
a donation platform ? (bitcoin, flattr, paypal account)


markers for days, seasons, months...(maybe on the orbit)
go forward 1 day, 1 month, 1season, 1year (soft date change)

NOTSURE??Camera INputHd and Interface should have scene as paramteter (not world)

follow and lookat without slowdowns (predictive movement)
look and follow instructions should be added to a list and then done sequentially
OR BETTER
done in parallel conserving speed

markers should not be seen when on camera position (0,0,0)

support years before 1 and 9999
support dates defore christ (datautil.date)

High resolution shadows idea :
You have only round geometric objects, so I think that you can try to use only mathematical functions in shader instead of rendered shadowmap image to avoid low resolution problems, but of course it require rewriting shaders.
