at noon earth should always show england to sun

utctimestamps for time representation (no astronomia?)

for shadows visibility update:
fadeIn = s.colorScaleInterval(3, Vec4(1,1,1,1), Vec4(1,1,1,0))
fadeOut = s.colorScaleInterval(3, Vec4(1,1,1,0))

put the docs in the software !! 
make small website
a donation platform ? (bitcoin, flattr, paypal account)

labels
markers for days, seasons, months...(maybe on the orbit)

scale free move speed

NOTSURE??Camera INputHd and Interface should have scene as paramteter (not world)

follow and lookat without slowdowns (predictive movement)
look and follow instructions should be added to a list and then done sequentially
OR BETTER
done in parallel conserving speed

markers should not be seen when on camera position (0,0,0)

support years before 1 and 9999
support dates defore christ (datautil.date)

High resolution shadows idea :
You have only round geometric objects, so I think that you can try to use only mathematical functions in shader instead of rendered shadowmap image to avoid low resolution problems, but of course it require rewriting shaders.
